There are 2 @Test methods that will run in correct order(dependency) as part of the test suite - 
1. testCreateRepeatingEvent()
    -performs Login, and creates a Repeating Event 
2. testSchedule()
    -performs Login, and verifies the data fields of the repeating events created in prior test

DATA CLEANUP for re-running tests: 
1. Before re-running the tests, perform a manual cleanup by deleting the Repeating Events in the app prior to subsequent test runs.
2. Also, Location dropdown field gets populated with a new location each run, and if there are 3+ locations in the dropdown list, causes the test to fail to select the "Create New Location" menu item.
To resolve this, need to delete the Team from the web app, and re-create the Team with the same name. This will remove the previous locations from the dropdown.


REQUIREMENTS TO RUN LOCALLY:
1. Requires JAVA <= 15 to work properly with PageFactory (due to existing PageFactory bug - https://github.com/appium/java-client/issues/1575)
2. requires local Appium server started at default path http://localhost:4723
3. Requires Android Emulator for running on android device
4. copy of the TeamSnap Android app with "app" path hardcoded in LocalAppiumConfig.java in setUp() method
5. Run with `mvn test -Pandroid`

ISSUE with Browserstack:
Using the pointer sequence actions works LOCALLY to scroll Calendar and set time on Time widget 
and selecting items in some dropdown lists (Location list, Repeat Frequency list). However these actions are failing
on Browserstack with "UnsupportedCommand actions"
